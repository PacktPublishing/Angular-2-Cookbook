#Angular 2 Cookbook
This is the code repository for [Angular 2 Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/angular-2-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785881923), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Angular 2 introduces an entirely new way to build applications. It wholly embraces all the newest concepts that are built into the next generation of browsers, and it cuts away all the fat and bloat from Angular 1. This book plunges directly into the heart of all the most important Angular 2 concepts for you to conquer. In addition to covering all the Angular 2 fundamentals, such as components, forms, and services, it demonstrates how the framework embraces a range of new web technologies such as ES6 and TypeScript syntax, Promises, Observables, and Web Workers, among many others.

##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<p>{{date}}</p>
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
<h3>Written by: {{author}}</h3>
```
